# Cursor IDE Permission Settings

## macOS System Preferences

To prevent Cursor from stopping for permissions, configure the following:

### 1. Full Disk Access
1. Open **System Settings** (or System Preferences on older macOS)
2. Go to **Privacy & Security** → **Full Disk Access**
3. Click the **+** button
4. Navigate to `/Applications/Cursor.app` and add it
5. Make sure the checkbox is enabled

### 2. Terminal Access
1. Go to **Privacy & Security** → **Terminal**
2. Add Cursor if it's not already listed
3. Enable the checkbox

### 3. Developer Tools
1. Go to **Privacy & Security** → **Developer Tools**
2. Add Cursor and enable it

### 4. Files and Folders
1. Go to **Privacy & Security** → **Files and Folders**
2. Ensure Cursor has access to:
   - **Documents Folder**
   - **Downloads Folder**
   - **Desktop Folder**
   - **Removable Volumes** (if needed)

## Cursor Settings

### Enable Auto-approve for Common Operations
1. Open Cursor Settings (Cmd + ,)
2. Search for "permissions" or "security"
3. Enable:
   - **Auto-approve file operations**
   - **Auto-approve terminal commands** (use with caution)
   - **Trust workspace**

### Workspace Trust
1. When opening a workspace, Cursor may ask to trust it
2. Click **"Trust Workspace"** to avoid future prompts
3. Or add to trusted workspaces in settings

## File Permissions

Ensure your project files have correct permissions:

```bash
# Make sure you own the project directory
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /Users/saideepak.b/work/self/ConfluenceAiAnalyser

# Set appropriate permissions
chmod -R 755 /Users/saideepak.b/work/self/ConfluenceAiAnalyser
```

## Terminal Commands

If Cursor stops for terminal command permissions:

1. **Grant Terminal Access** (see macOS settings above)
2. **Use Cursor's integrated terminal** instead of external terminal
3. **Add to trusted commands** in Cursor settings

## Quick Fixes

### For File Operations
- Ensure you have write permissions to the project directory
- Check if files are locked or read-only
- Use `chmod` to fix permissions if needed

### For Git Operations
- Configure Git credentials once
- Use SSH keys instead of HTTPS to avoid repeated password prompts
- Store credentials in keychain

### For Build/Run Operations
- Ensure Gradle/npm have execute permissions
- Check if antivirus is blocking operations
- Add project directory to antivirus exclusions if needed

## Verification

Test if permissions are working:
```bash
# Should work without prompts
cd /Users/saideepak.b/work/self/ConfluenceAiAnalyser
./gradlew --version
cd frontend && npm --version
```

## Additional Tips

1. **Run Cursor with elevated permissions** (not recommended for security)
2. **Add project to Cursor's trusted workspaces**
3. **Disable macOS Gatekeeper for development** (use with caution)
4. **Use Cursor's built-in terminal** which has fewer permission issues
